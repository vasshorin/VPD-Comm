# How to add data.

To get started, make sure the schema in which the table is is connected. This is shown by a bold lettered name.

To retrieve data, we need to insert some values in the table first. To insert values, you do the following procedure.

### Note: 
The number of columns must match the number of comma separated values. For example, in the image above, if we are inserting into 3 specified columns, we should also insert 3 comma separated values. 
For demonstration, we are going to insert some values in our Persons table following the syntax above.

#### Step 1: Type the following query to insert data.

#### Step 3: Run the query by click this icon.

Once we run the query, the following message will output in the Output sub-menu at the bottom of your screen.
