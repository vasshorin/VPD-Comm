To get started, make sure the schema in which contains the table is connected. This is shown by a bold lettered name as shown below. 
![Connected schema](https://github.com/vasshorin/VPD-Comm/blob/Gh-pages/assets/images/add20.png?raw=true)

To retrieve data, we need to insert some values in the table first. To insert values, you do the following procedure. 

![Insert Syntax](https://github.com/vasshorin/VPD-Comm/blob/Gh-pages/assets/images/add2.png?raw=true)

### Note: 
The number of columns must match the number of comma separated values. For example, in the image above, if we are inserting into 3 specified columns, we should also insert 3 comma separated values. 
For demonstration, we are going to insert some values in our Persons table following the syntax above.

1. Type the following query to insert data.
![Insert data](https://github.com/vasshorin/VPD-Comm/blob/Gh-pages/assets/images/add3.png?raw=true)

2. Select the whole query

3. Run the query by click this icon.
![Run query](https://github.com/vasshorin/VPD-Comm/blob/Gh-pages/assets/images/add4.png?raw=true)

Once we run the query, the following message will output in the Output sub-menu at the bottom of your screen.
![Query sub-menu](https://github.com/vasshorin/VPD-Comm/blob/Gh-pages/assets/images/add6.png?raw=true)

From the image above, box 1 shows a green check mark, which signifies your query ran successfully. Infact, you will see this everytime a query is successfully run. Box 2 shows how many rows were created, which is 4 in this case. There is also additional information like duplicated rows and possible errors. In our example, we created 4 unique rows without errors. 

Congratulations, you have succesully learned how to add data to a table using basic queries!
